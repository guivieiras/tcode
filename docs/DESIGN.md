# Tcode design spec

The visual and interaction contract for Tcode. Update it deliberately when a
product decision changes; historical design drafts are not additional rules.
There is one shell, described here; **Compact layout** below covers the narrow
end of it.

The product display name is **Tcode**. The shared UI uses the existing `app.name`
locale key for its standalone name. Commands, crate and bundle identifiers,
URLs, file names and data directories retain lowercase `tcode`.

## One shell, one layout rule

Desktop, iOS, Android and the browser run the same shell. It has exactly one
layout rule:

> **Compact iff the available logical content width — the viewport width minus
> whatever the system occludes on its left and right — is under 900px.** At
> exactly 900 the layout is wide.

Nothing else decides it. Not the operating system, not the input device, not a
saved preference: a desktop window dragged narrow is compact, an iPad in
landscape is wide, and rotating a phone changes the layout the same way
dragging a window edge does. The rule is never persisted, because a window
width is not a setting.

Input-device behavior is a separate question with a separate answer. Whether
Enter submits follows the *keyboard*, not the width: a wide tablet still types
on glass, and a narrow desktop window still has a hardware Enter key.

Crossing the breakpoint is a layout change and nothing else. It never detaches
from the host, never reconnects, and never rebuilds a view that holds user
state. The selected thread, the composer draft and its selection, pending
attachments, approvals, scroll position and focus all survive in both
directions, and the sidebar and right-panel widths come back as they were left
when the window widens again.

## Capability-appropriate UI

Every product view is built by every client. A view is never compiled away
because of the platform it happens to run on: the difference between clients is
which *operations* they can perform, not which screens exist.

An operation is gated only when it is genuinely native — a file dialog, an
embedded webview, macOS permission grants, dictation, the AppKit pasteboard,
launching an editor — and then by two independent things: whether this build has
the capability at all, and whether it applies to the current attachment. A
picker that browses this machine is meaningless while the workspace runs on
another one, so it is withheld even where the build has it.

Where an operation is unavailable, the view says which machine can perform it
and offers what it can (open externally, copy, type the value) instead of a
control that would do nothing. A client never infers the host's state from its
own operating system, and never reports a success it did not perform.

| Preview operation | macOS | Windows | Android | iOS / Web / Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| URL, external browser, copy | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Embedded page, history, JS automation, navigation errors | Yes | Yes | Yes | Unavailable |
| Visible page PNG | Yes | Unavailable | Yes | Unavailable |
| Local port discovery | Local workspace | Local workspace | Hidden | Hidden |

Native preview capabilities require the `native-preview` build feature. Android
uses normal WebView TLS validation and blocks insecure mixed content in HTTPS
pages. Downloads, file uploads and new-window popups have no Android preview
integration yet. Native child overlays can cover overlapping GPUI popovers;
the command palette and navigation away hide the child explicitly.

## Design tokens

The embedded [theme](../themes/tcode.json) owns colors and font choices;
[material.rs](../crates/ui/src/material.rs) owns surface treatments, shared
geometry and radii. Use those definitions rather than maintaining a second
palette in documentation.

Browser shell icons are embedded from the same dependency-owned icon set that
generates the shared icon names. Rendering navigation never requires a separate
asset server or internet access.

DM Sans is bundled for UI text and comes from the same font resource on every
client. Desktop monospace text uses the configured system family; iOS and
Android and the browser register the same bundled Lilex faces in its place.
The browser terminal uses an embedded monospace Nerd Fonts symbol fallback for prompt
icons absent from Lilex; terminal text retains fixed cell spacing. Android uses the system
Noto Color Emoji fallback, including COLRv1 color glyphs on modern devices. Native debug builds embed fonts and SVGs in the
package rather than reading a development machine's asset path.
Android loads the device's system fonts and explicitly prefers Noto Sans CJK SC,
Noto Sans SC, then Source Han Sans SC for missing UI glyphs; CJK fonts are not
bundled. iOS retains its native system fallback (including PingFang).
On Android, hiding the software keyboard preserves input focus; tapping inside
that input opens the keyboard again. Backspace removes a whole grapheme or the
selection, including while an IME composing region is active. Multiline fields
request a newline key from Android IMEs; plain Enter inserts a line break in
the composer. Single-line fields keep a Done action that invokes their existing
submit or next-step behavior. Modified hardware Enter bindings are unchanged.
Android keyboard suggestions replace the complete word or composing region,
including corrections after moving the cursor. The keyboard's text and selection
follow composer clears, restored drafts and app edits; delayed keyboard updates
must not restore text that was already sent.
The centered chat/composer column is 720px wide at most. Desktop prose and
composer text use 13.5px type with a 21px line height; metadata is smaller and
muted, with monospace for paths, command text and numeric evidence.

The material layers are:

| Layer | Use | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T0 | Sidebar and window edges | Translucent theme canvas over the native window material; the wide sidebar has a subtle lighter tint |
| T1 | Chat, right panel and Settings reading surfaces | Near-opaque warm paper in light mode, blue carbon in dark mode |
| T2 | Inline fields, hover and selection | Theme-derived tints |
| T3 | Composer, popovers, dialogs, menus and toasts | Opaque popover fill, hairline border and soft shadow |

Keep the same material composition when navigating between Chat and Settings.
Separate reading regions with space and material contrast; use faded or inset
hairlines where a rule is needed. Hover and focus must not change geometry.
Diff additions and deletions use the success and danger colors consistently.

The window root supplies the active theme's foreground color and UI font to
the shell, dialogs and toasts. Overlay text inherits these defaults, including
when switching between light and dark mode; explicit semantic colors and
monospace text override them where needed.

Dialog backdrops, including the image lightbox, use the shared dimming scrim
from the command palette and sheets. They darken the page in both themes.

## Window material

The persistent main window uses native backdrop material: macOS keeps its
existing blurred vibrancy, while Windows deliberately uses GPUI's
`WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred`, which the locked Windows backend maps to
Acrylic Accent state 4. Mica was rejected because it did not provide the
perceptible live background-through blur required in the exposed T0 sidebar and
window-edge regions. Both native materials retain the embedded theme's
translucent canvas so the system backdrop can show through.
`TCODE_NO_VIBRANCY=1` keeps its macOS-only
diagnostic behavior: an opaque window with a flattened canvas. Linux and other
platforms remain opaque and flatten that canvas to its solid RGB base. In-app
T3 child surfaces (popovers, menus, dialogs, drawers and toasts) use the fully
opaque `popover.background` token so lower layers never show through; they do
not receive native Acrylic.

### Launch

The Android adaptive launcher icon preserves the original desktop/iOS charcoal
background gradient (#313131 to #141414) and muted salmon/orange folded T
(#DD6660 / #E1955A, with a shaded stem), independent of system theme. Its
foreground has about 25% padding on each side so launcher masks do not clip the glyph. The splash uses the transparent glyph drawable
separately, without the launcher's charcoal background.

Mobile launch screens show only the app icon glyph centered on the embedded
theme’s opaque canvas, with system light/dark variants and matching system bars.
Android uses the system splash through AndroidX and holds it until GPUI’s first
successful frame presentation; iOS uses the same canvas and glyph in its native
launch screen and a matching cover held until the first GPUI presentation.
Native host backgrounds keep that canvas until the shell draws,
so startup never exposes a default white/black window or decorative backdrop.

## Layout metrics (at 1440×900)

- Sidebar is resizable. Collapsed it occupies **0px** —
  no icon strip, no layout node at all: the chat (and right panel) run to the
  window's left edge. Collapsed, entering the first 12px at the window's left
  edge reveals the sidebar as an **overlay** (see Sidebar below).
- Window top is seamless: no app titlebar — the sidebar's first row (traffic
  lights inset 74px, wordmark + channel pill) and the chat header (52px) form
  the top strip; both are window-drag areas. Header controls, including compact
  navigation and split buttons, consume left mouse presses so clicking them
  with slight pointer movement does not start a window drag.
- Chat content column: max-width 720px, centered, ≥24px horizontal padding
  (must reflow, never clip, when the diff panel narrows the chat region).
- Composer: floating opaque card with the shared composer radius, a hairline
  border and subtle shadow. Focus changes the border color without resizing it.
- Timeline-to-composer spacing: **16px** from the last timeline row's bottom
  edge to the composer card's top edge when scrolled to the end, in both compact
  and wide layouts, including when the last row has a running status. The timeline
  wrapper owns this gap outside the `List`; the composer adds no top inset.
- Sidebar thread rows ≈30px, 14px text, 4px-radius hover bg.
- Parent thread rows always show a disclosure chevron and total-child badge;
  when children are active, the badge reads active/total in the success color.

## Connection baseline

Before the first Index and Settings snapshots are applied, Threads and the wide
sidebar show the same neutral loading rows. Chat also waits for the selected
thread's SessionStatus and SessionEvents baseline. No empty-workspace or
empty-conversation message appears while that content is unknown. Empty messages
are reserved for an applied, genuinely empty baseline.

A reconnect keeps cached lists and conversations visible. The connection banner
and dot show **Syncing / 同步中** until the workspace and selected thread have
received their replayed baseline, then **Connected**. Loading state belongs to
the attachment's store and survives layout changes.

## Opening a conversation

Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+9 open the corresponding thread in the current thread-list
order. Ctrl+Tab opens the next thread and Ctrl+Shift+Tab opens the previous one,
wrapping at either end. Navigation follows the current layout, sort, project
filter and expanded groups, including rows outside the scroll viewport but
excluding folded-away threads. A number beyond the list length does nothing;
with no listed thread selected, next starts at the first and previous at the
last. These use Control on every platform. While the model picker is open,
number shortcuts remain with the picker.

The first tap selects the sidebar row and pushes the compact Thread destination
immediately. Until both status and timeline arrive, the chat shows a muted message
skeleton. Selecting that conversation again sends no requests. Changing selection
retires the old subscription generation; its late snapshot cannot replace the new
conversation.

Menus and dismissible popovers consume the outside pointer sequence that closes
them, including its release. The underlying row or control acts only on a second
tap or click. Closing or choosing a menu clears its transient state; thread-row
selection follows the selected conversation, independently of which row opened a
menu.

## Timeline history

A newly opened conversation starts with up to the last 400 event records, within
an 8 MiB envelope. On the first layout (including cold-start restore), and after
every prepend, earlier history loads until the content above the viewport covers
six viewport heights or history is exhausted. The same six-screen threshold
triggers scroll-ahead loading. Only one page of at most 200 records loads at a
time, with a 250ms yield between pages so layout can measure the new content.
Leaving the conversation cancels the sequence. A one-viewport placeholder before
the first loaded turn reserves scrollable space for incoming history; while
loading, its bottom 24pt row shows a small centered spinner. The reservation is
excluded from the loaded-window measurement and moves back as pages arrive,
preserving the visible turn and pixel offset. There is no load control,
end-of-history message, or page-error feedback. Failed pages are logged and
retried when the prefetch condition is met again, with at most one retry per
five seconds.

Prepending preserves the visible turn and its offset in pixels. Existing list
measurements and markdown state remain resident; only new or changed turns need
measurement. A page may complete a partially loaded turn. Live replay cursors
remain absolute event positions, independent of how much earlier history is
currently visible. Snapshots and pages fit within 8 MiB including their serialized
envelope; a single record that cannot fit produces an explicit error.

The jump-to-latest pill appears when more than one timeline viewport remains
below the reading position. Its visibility follows the list's pixel geometry
on wheel, captured touch, and programmatic scrolling, and after history or
layout changes; unmeasured offscreen history does not suppress it. Following is
independent of that threshold: any upward user scroll pauses following immediately,
including wheel, captured touch, scrollbar drag and keyboard scrolling. Incoming
content and history paging preserve the reading anchor while paused. Following
resumes only when the reader scrolls back to the bottom (within one pixel) or
clicks the pill. Opening a conversation starts at the tail.

The timeline uses the space above the composer's measured height, including its
attached compact settings drawer, and never overlaps it. Vertical breathing room belongs
to the timeline container, outside the list's scroll extent, so captured touch,
wheel and tail following agree on the bottom. The shell reserves the window's
safe-area/IME inset once. The running-status row remains fully visible above the
composer at the end, including when the keyboard opens or closes.

## Scrolling contract

The conversation timeline overlays a vertical scrollbar at its right edge,
using the shared theme's hover/scroll visibility. Its track follows the list's
viewport, excluding the timeline padding and composer. Dragging it moves the
conversation and pauses tail-following when the reader leaves the bottom.

Thread lists also overlay the shared vertical scrollbar, in Recent and By
project at both layout widths. Each scrollbar follows its list's viewport and
scroll position; headers, search controls and footers stay outside its track.
Virtualized lists estimate offscreen row heights so the thumb represents the
whole list from the first frame; measured heights refine that estimate.

Vertical mouse-wheel notches ease over about 125ms in Tcode's registered scroll
views (chat, sidebars, settings, and diffs). Repeated input accumulates; reversing
direction discards the previous direction's remaining movement. Trackpad pixels,
native touch, textareas, and custom horizontal/terminal scrolling retain their
existing input handling. Reduced motion uses direct scrolling. Pointer presses,
keyboard input, and direct positioning interrupt wheel animation. Scrolling up
releases chat tail-following immediately; animation uses relative movement so
row remeasurement and prepended history preserve the reading anchor.

Potentially unbounded content always has its own resolved-height viewport and a
separate, non-shrinking content column. Headers, search fields, footers and
actions stay outside that viewport. This applies to the sidebar project list,
Settings content, command-palette results, Add Project recents (capped at
390px), ACP/model catalogs, model traits, branch and diff-scope selectors,
queued messages, user-input options, approval details and expanded toast
details. A bounded flex column with `overflow` on the same node is not an
acceptable substitute: flexbox can shrink its rows until no scrollable overflow
remains.

Those heights are desktop design sizes, and the same views open at every width.
Each is capped to what the window can actually show, so a short window scrolls
the list instead of pushing the footer off-screen. Dialogs are capped the same
way — width and height — because a dialog wider than the viewport is also
positioned off-centre.

## Compact layout

### Destinations

Compact replaces the split with a navigation stack over one history:

**Machines → Threads → Thread → Panel**, plus **Add a machine** over Machines and
**Settings → Settings section** over wherever they were opened from, pushed and
popped with a 200ms lateral transition.

On iOS and Android, a cold launch restores the client-local navigation path,
selected conversation and machine. Settings pages restore the page beneath them;
Add a machine restores Machines. A removed machine returns to Machines. A
conversation missing from the host's Index baseline returns to Threads; until
that baseline arrives the restored page shows its loading skeleton. Desktop
launch behavior is unchanged.

- **Machines** — which machine this window talks to, and nothing else: **This
  machine** where the device has one, the added machines, one **Add a machine**
  button and the machines found nearby. It is the root of a window with no
  attachment, and it can also be *visited* from an attached workspace through
  the sidebar's feature area (see **Sidebar**) without leaving that machine.
  Letting other devices connect to this machine is a setting of this machine
  and lives in **Settings → Other devices**, never here. **This machine** is a
  row like any other on the page: title over one muted subtitle, no leading
  icon, and the connection dot in the same trailing slot a saved machine's
  takes.
- **Add a machine** — the connection form, pushed by **Add a machine**, by a
  **Nearby machines** row that prefilled an endpoint, or by a
  rejected-authentication row's **Pair again**.
  Labels sit above full-width fields, the primary action is pinned at the foot
  of the page above the keyboard, and adding ends with the machine name and **Connect**. The single **Address**
  field accepts a host, host:port, or full HTTP(S) origin.
- **Threads** — the shared sidebar under a nav bar titled **Threads**, with the
  attached machine's name as its subtitle and new-thread and settings actions.
  New thread starts a draft directly when the machine has one project and
  otherwise opens the command palette, which already owns "new thread in
  ‹project›" and can search. Choosing a project closes the palette and pushes
  Thread even when reusing the selected draft. The draft page is titled
  **‹project name› / New thread** (localized); the composer stays
  unfocused until tapped. **Recent** is the default: all unarchived threads
  across projects ordered by the latest activity of each parent and its children,
  with children ordered by their own activity directly below their parent.
  Both views indent children 16pt beyond the row inset and use lighter titles;
  status glyphs and washes are unchanged. A parent’s child-count disclosure
  toggles the same per-parent collapse state as the wide sidebar. Collapsing
  hides children without changing family ordering; running children keep their
  parent in Recent. Children with archived or missing parents remain top-level
  with a muted “(parent unavailable)” subtitle. Recent shows the project name beside the
  relative time in the muted subtitle. **By project** keeps the grouped list.
  The list header has a 44pt layout toggle sharing the wide sidebar’s persisted
  Flat/Grouped setting; search opens the shared palette in either view. Both
  views use the same plain rows, status glyphs and approval/input washes.
  In By project, a header separates one project from the next, so it appears
  only from the second project onwards: with a single project the threads are
  listed directly, under no caption.
- **Thread** — the shared chat view. Its desktop header is replaced by the nav
  bar; the timeline, composer, approvals and user-input panels are the same
  entities the wide layout uses.
- **Panel** — the terminal, diff, plan and preview at full width, chosen from a
  segmented control. They are the same entities the wide layout puts in the
  split: a compact window has less room, not less product. Export and the
  per-thread actions stay on the thread row's context menu.
  The segmented control is the page's **only** selector, so a panel does not
  also draw its own tab row, and it drops the right column's expand / split /
  close controls — Back is how you leave the page. What remains is one toolbar
  row on the page inset with 44pt touch targets: the diff's source and base
  pickers, the terminal's tab strip and a new-terminal target, the preview's
  address field. Everything else moves into that row's overflow menu.
  Preview's overflow includes **Close preview**, which destroys the conversation's
  browser and clears its URL and history, leaving URL entry in the same panel.
  The next navigation creates a fresh browser. Compact previews are also released
  when leaving Thread for Threads, switching conversations or machines, or deleting
  the conversation. Switching panel segments or moving Panels ↔ Thread only hides
  the browser and preserves the page. Wide-layout preview behavior is unchanged.
- **Settings** and **Settings section** — the section list, then one section's
  detail (see **Settings** below).

**One navigation bar.** Every compact page — Settings included — is composed as
the same 52pt nav bar: Back at the top left, a centered title that truncates
rather than colliding with its controls, an optional muted subtitle under it,
and at most two trailing actions. No compact page draws a header of its own or
puts a Back control at the bottom of a list.

**Back is labelled with a place, not a title.** Each destination owns one short
fixed label — Machines, Threads, Thread, Panels, Settings — and a Back control
carries the label of the destination it returns to (Add a machine answers with
its caller's, Machines; a settings section returns to Settings). Dynamic titles
never reach a Back control, so it never truncates and never changes width when
a machine or thread is renamed. The nav bar reserves the same room on both
sides at every page, so the centered title does not shift between pages.

Back — the Android system gesture and every Back control — unwinds in one order:
the software keyboard or composition, then the topmost dismissible overlay
(dialog, menu, palette), then one entry of the window's history. It reports "not
consumed" only at the root, where the platform closes the app. Non-dismissible
dialogs, such as import progress and approval prompts, keep refusing dismissal.

**Navigating never detaches.** Walking back from Threads to Machines, or
visiting Machines from an open thread, keeps the link, the selected thread and
every view over that workspace. Only two things detach: connecting to a
*different* machine, which clears the previous machine's history and lands on
the new machine's threads, and an explicit **Disconnect** in a machine row's
own menu. **Remove** removes the saved credential and leaves a live attachment
running. Resizing never detaches and keeps the page the window is on.

### The window seam

A window is not always the rectangle it reports: a status bar, a notch, a home
indicator or a software keyboard can cover part of it. Those edges belong to the
*window*, not to the host the workspace is attached to.

There is one safe content rectangle, shared by pages, the palette, dialogs and
toasts. Bottom avoidance is **max(safe area, keyboard)**, never their sum — a
keyboard that already covers the home indicator does not need it counted twice.
Backgrounds paint edge to edge; only interactive content is constrained, and
only once. The browser canvas is already resized around its on-screen keyboard,
so the client adds no inset of its own there and takes its size from the actual
canvas.

Insets change without a timer: the platform schedules a frame when they move, so
the layout follows the keyboard immediately.

### Bottom sheets

The shared command palette opens from the Threads search pill and the Search nav action on Thread, attached Machines and Settings pages, using a full-width bottom sheet with a focused input above touch-scrollable commands and search results.

Compact pickers and details use the shared bottom sheet: an opaque T3 surface
spanning the full window width, independent of the wide popover’s desktop width.
Only its top corners are rounded, at 16pt; content is inset 16pt. The full-page
scrim includes the window seam, while bottom padding on that layer places the
sheet above `max(safe.bottom, ime.bottom)`. Its height is capped below the 52pt
nav bar plus the top safe area; taller content scrolls inside the sheet. Tapping
the scrim dismisses and consumes the whole pointer sequence, including release.

### Toasts

Compact notifications are system-style pills centered horizontally in the safe
content rectangle, 16pt above its effective bottom edge (including the keyboard).
They fit their content up to the available width minus 32pt. One fully rounded,
opaque T3 surface with a soft shadow contains 15pt text, normally one line and
clamped to two, with 12pt vertical and 16pt horizontal padding and a 44pt minimum
height. A status glyph and one trailing inline action are optional. There is no
separate title, detail expander or close button; tapping the pill dismisses it.
The surrounding layer does not intercept page input.

A pill fades and slides up over 150ms, then dismisses after 3 seconds (5 with an
action). New messages immediately replace old ones; there is no pending backlog.
Errors use the existing dialog on compact so required recovery actions and
technical details cannot disappear. Wide windows retain their corner cards,
stack, details, close controls and existing timing.

### Touch and typography

Native touch pans capture the innermost registered scroll viewport at touch-down.
The capture keeps the same handle through redraws, finger movement, and momentum;
a textarea moving beneath the finger or the original anchor cannot steal it.
ScrollHandle and list viewports can hand excess movement once to their nearest
registered scroll ancestor. Textareas keep exclusive capture at their limits
because their public scroll API clamps after layout. A new touch replaces the
capture; cancel stops it. Taps, long presses, selection drags, and desktop mouse
wheel dispatch retain GPUI's normal recognition. The UI owner is
[`touch_scroll.rs`](../crates/ui/src/touch_scroll.rs).

- Pages inset 16pt left and right; nav bars are 52pt plus the top safe area.
  Icon buttons have a 44×44pt touch target and use the shared stroke icons in
  the foreground color.
- The compact composer's radius is 16pt. Other shared components keep their own
  material radii.
- Empty states are an icon, a title, a short explanation and any necessary
  primary action, centered and width-limited; they show no desktop shortcuts.
- Nothing depends on hover. Long text, model lists and variable-length option
  sets wrap or scroll rather than truncating a choice away.
- Compact approval cards default to expanded, with deny and allow on one row and
  every other available action on its own; user questions keep their options,
  free text and editor prefill.

### The compact inset rule

One inset, applied once, at the page:

- **Page inset 16pt** left and right. Every compact page's content — the diff,
  plan/tasks and preview bodies included — starts and ends there. A view that
  the wide layout draws in the right column does not get to keep the column's
  denser padding when it becomes a page.
- **Card inset 12pt.** A card, notice, chip or row *inside* that content pads a
  further 12pt; it never re-applies the page inset.
- **Timeline-to-composer gap 16pt**, once, as in wide layout. No additional
  separator spacer or composer top padding is added to the timeline's bottom inset.
- **Terminal exception.** The terminal grid stays edge to edge horizontally —
  it is measured in columns, and narrowing it drops columns — but it still sits
  inside the window's safe rect and keeps 8pt of air below the segmented control.
  On iOS and Android, focusing the grid raises the software keyboard and adds one
  44pt special-key row at the bottom of that rect, directly above the keyboard.
  The row reserves its height before the grid is measured, so it never covers the
  last terminal row. Esc, Tab, sticky Ctrl and Alt stay pinned at the leading
  edge. Four arrows, the one-tap `^C` and `^D` combos, and symbols `- / | ~ : . _`
  share a horizontally scrolling strip with touch momentum, clipped to the row.
  Keys retain 44pt targets; trailing padding gives the strip breathing room at
  its end. The strip has no vertical scroll range. Sticky
  modifiers highlight until the next terminal key or committed character consumes
  them; a combo carries its own Control, encodes through the same key mapping a
  hardware Ctrl+C takes, and consumes any sticky modifier rather than doubling
  it. Tapping the grid or a key explicitly reopens the software keyboard even
  when the terminal retained focus after keyboard dismissal, on both mobile
  platforms. Desktop and browser terminals never draw the row.

Prose inside the content (errors, notices, file headers) wraps against the page
inset rather than running past it. Code and diff lines do not wrap: they scroll
horizontally *inside* the body, so the page edge stays where it is.

A row that pairs a label and description with a control follows the same rule as
Settings: on a compact page the control moves to its own full-width line under
the text, so the description is never squeezed into a column a word wide. A
fixed 44pt affordance — a switch — is the exception and stays beside its label.

### One list style

Two kinds of list, one rule for which is which:

- **Navigable content lists** — threads, machines, nearby machines, projects —
  are **plain rows**: no card, no border, no radius. Each row is at least 56pt
  tall at the 16pt page inset, separated from the next by a hairline indented
  to that inset, with a hover fill on a pointer and a pressed tint everywhere.
  Sections carry a caption in one shared style; a project header is that
  caption plus its collapse affordance. A row's own overflow trigger (the
  machine row's "…") keeps its 44×44 hit region *inside* the row, so the row's
  hover fill covers the whole row rather than stopping short of a seam.
- **Settings-like forms** — the Settings sections, **Other devices**, **Add a
  machine** — keep the grouped floating card with inset hairlines between rows.

So Machines and Threads read as one family of pages, and neither reads as a
settings page.

### Connection states

| State | Presentation |
| --- | --- |
| Connecting | The initial index has not arrived; the thread list shows a loading skeleton |
| Syncing | Hello accepted; waiting for the first host message |
| Connected | First host message received and the link healthy; no status banner |
| Reconnecting | Content is kept; the banner names the retry attempt and failure reason |
| Offline | Terminal authentication or protocol failure; the banner explains how to recover |
| Certificate changed / authentication rejected | An explicit error and a **Pair again** entry point; retrying stops |
| Protocol mismatch | **Update the app**; retrying stops |

Offline keeps the last received replica readable and disables writes; visited
threads keep their events, and unvisited ones may have only their list summary.
Reconnecting resubscribes to the current thread. A native app returning to the
foreground, or a browser page becoming visible again, interrupts the backoff and
retries at once.

## Surface anatomy

### Sidebar

Expanded, it is the first panel of the workspace resizable group (220–380px,
dragged width remembered across collapse/expand and window resizes). Collapsed,
it is **not in the layout at all**. A fixed, invisible 12px-wide element-level
hover trigger sits at the left edge and only opens the sidebar. The revealed
sidebar is a separate absolute sibling at its remembered width, rendered as a
shadowed overlay
*painted on top of* the chat: the content columns never reflow when it appears
or disappears. The trigger ignores hover-exit; the overlay's own occluding
hitbox and hover listener keep it open while occupied and close it when the
pointer leaves. It is strictly transient state, never persisted, and command
palette / dialogs / toasts still layer above it. Its own contents are identical
in both states.

1. App row: "Tcode" bold 14px, channel pill ("DEV"). No collapse button — the
   toggle lives in the chat header, since a collapsed sidebar has no width to
   host it.
2. Search row: magnifier + "Search" muted + ⌘K (macOS) / Ctrl+K
   (Windows/Linux) kbd chip → opens the palette.
3. Feature area: the window's persistent entries, directly under the search
   field at both widths, `flex_none` and outside the thread list's scrolling and
   filtering. Each entry is one sidebar-sized row — leading stroke icon, label,
   a muted trailing value and, where it has one, a status glyph — and it takes
   the selected surface while its destination is showing. Compact rows are 44pt
   for touch. Today it holds one entry, **Machines**, whose trailing value is the
   attached machine's name (or "Not connected") with the connection glyph; it
   navigates to `Destination::Hosts` without disturbing the attachment. Later
   persistent features are rows here, not new controls elsewhere.
4. Project/thread header: sort, grouped/flat layout and add-project controls.
   Sorting and layout choices are persisted.
5. Project groups: rotating chevron + folder icon + 15px medium name; hover
   shows "+" (new thread in project); collapse state persisted.
   Thread rows: single-line truncated AI-generated title (first-message fallback
   while naming) + relative time (muted 11px); hover = accent bg. Inline rename
   commits on Enter and cancels on blur or any click outside the input.
   The thread context menu offers **Regenerate title / 重新生成标题** next to
   Rename in both layouts. It uses the original request and recent conversation
   to name the subject and desired outcome. While a title request is pending on
   the host, the action reads **Regenerating… / 正在重新生成…** and is disabled
   on every connected client. A small spinner appears beside the existing title
   at both widths. Regeneration preserves the thread's activity timestamp and
   list position; a manual rename wins over a late result. Failure preserves the
   title and shows an error.
   Thread rows have a 6px gap. Relative ages omit the suffix ("5m", "2h", "3d").
   Trailing time labels align to the same right edge regardless of their width.
   On hover, an idle, unsettled thread swaps its time for a circle-check Settle
   action; settled rows keep their time. Active = persistent accent bg. A running
   session shows its elapsed working time (blue, 11px, e.g. "1m 05s") in the
   trailing timestamp slot, right-aligned with idle ages on the title line.
   More than six threads add a "Show more" / "Show less" toggle row (available after
   expansion so the list can be collapsed again). Collapsing a project folder
   resets only that project's expanded thread list, including when collapsed
   in compact layout; reopening in wide layout shows at most six visible threads.
   Compact layout keeps its existing full thread list. Other
   projects' expansions and parent/child folds stay unchanged. Children hidden
   by a parent fold do not consume the six-thread limit.
6. Footer: gear + "Settings" → settings route.

**Settings → General → Workspace → Thread ordering and time** offers
**Current (default)** and **Last user message**. The default preserves
activity timestamps and the wide flat list's waiting/working priority. Last user
message orders threads and displays their relative age using user-authored sends
and steering, without status priority. Agent replies, orchestration messages,
scheduled work, and opening a thread do not advance that time. The choice is
saved on the attached host and applies to both layouts, both window widths, and
thread timestamps in the command palette. Parent/child groups stay together and
sort by the parent's last user message; children sort by their own. Project
recency follows the same parent timestamps. Settled and archive grouping, and
completion markers, keep their existing behavior.

Existing histories recover their timestamps from stored user-role messages and
steering requests, which older logs cannot reliably distinguish from automated
input. Threads with no timestamped user message use their creation time.

At both widths and in both thread layouts, the former unread marker is
**Completed / 已完成**, shown as a green success dot. Thread status dots sit
immediately left of their time label: green for completed, blue for working.
Both use a 6px footprint and gently pulse between 35% and 100% opacity over
1.6 seconds, staying solid when reduced motion is enabled. Wide rows put this
pair at the trailing edge of the title line; compact rows keep it in the
metadata line, replacing the leading completed dot or working spinner.
A muted 12px pencil beside the time indicates unsent prompt text, before any
status dot. It appears while typing, remains when switching threads, and clears
when that prompt is sent or erased. Whitespace alone does not show the icon.
The tooltip and accessible label read **Unsent text / 未发送的文字**. This uses
the window's existing in-memory composer drafts in wide and compact layouts.
Project headers keep a green dot when a non-working top-level thread has that
marker. The thread context menu offers **Mark completed / 标记为已完成**.
The marker retains its last-visited behavior: opening the thread clears it, and child threads do not
show it.

Thread titles use 14px text in wide layout and 17px in compact layout. Project
names use 15px in wide group headers and 12px in Recent metadata; compact project
headers and metadata use 14px. Time labels keep their existing sizes.
All thread titles use the full theme foreground, white in dark mode, except
settled titles, which use 35% foreground opacity. Status glyphs and labels keep
their semantic colors; secondary project and time metadata remain muted. Working
durations update once per second from the host's current turn start timestamp,
including parked threads and remote clients. Waiting-for-approval and input
labels retain their existing wording. Compact rows use the same 6px gap and
duration labels.

In wide layout, the sidebar switches the content route directly: Machines
replaces Chat in the content column, and selecting a thread, starting a draft,
or choosing its project switches that column back to Chat. Wide routes do not
put Back in the Machines header or accumulate a page history. Compact keeps the
single navigation stack and its Back semantics described above.

### Chat header

52px. The first control is the **sidebar toggle**, immediately left of the
title: `PanelLeft` + "Collapse sidebar" while expanded, `PanelLeftOpen` +
"Expand sidebar" while collapsed. Then **‹project name› / ‹thread title›** in
15px medium, truncated to fit. Drafts use "New thread" as the thread title;
"No active thread" appears muted when empty. Compact uses the same combined
title in its navigation bar, without a separate project subtitle. The project
name follows the thread's project even when it runs in a worktree. The project
name uses muted foreground color and is a keyboard-accessible button that opens
that project's new-thread draft in its root checkout. Hover restores foreground
color. Its click target does not drag the window, and compact keeps a 44pt target.
The project label takes at most half the title width, leaving room for the thread
title; both truncate as needed. On the right:
the git/Open actions and the terminal · plan · preview · diff panel toggles.
The thread-title stretch is the window-drag handle; the toggle is a real button and never arms a drag. Collapsed on macOS (windowed) the
row is inset 80px so the toggle clears the native traffic lights; no other
platform pays that inset.

### Timeline

- Turns are separated by 32px; smaller gaps group blocks within a turn. There
  is no divider under the user bubble: space and typography separate prose from
  the muted activity summary.
- Subagent capsules use a spinner while active, then a compact lifecycle chip:
  green for completed, amber for interrupted, and red for failed or declined.
  Their model and reasoning-effort labels describe the child configuration.
  Unknown values stay hidden until child metadata arrives; missing spawn
  arguments never justify displaying the parent's model. A later metadata
  update preserves the child's current lifecycle status.
- Turn activity uses collapsible "Work Log" sections. A compact disclosure
  header reveals transparent activity rows
  (muted status icon + one-line command/tool/subagent/reasoning summary).
  Details sit beneath their row; execution traces do not need enclosing cards.
  While a turn is running,
  the latest five activities remain directly visible. Once a sixth arrives,
  only the older prefix is summarized by a collapsed Work Log row (with a
  working spinner on its right); those five visible activities are excluded
  from that row's counts. The newest command output or file-edit diff stays
  automatically expanded until a newer activity appears. A superseded detail
  folds immediately if it has already been visible for 500ms; otherwise it
  stays open only for the remainder of that minimum visibility window, unless
  another activity supersedes it first. A detail with two newer activities ahead
  of it folds immediately regardless of that window. Opening a running thread is
  a current-state snapshot, not a replay: among activities that arrived while
  the thread was away, only the newest detail opens, and its 500ms visibility
  window starts when the thread becomes visible.
  Manually toggling a detail overrides its automatic expansion: a collapsed
  detail stays closed through subsequent updates, while a manually expanded
  detail stays open when newer activities arrive. These choices are scoped to
  each activity and session and remembered while the chat view is open, including
  when switching threads. New activities still follow the automatic rules.
  The **Live command panel** setting controls automatic command-output expansion
  only; file-edit diffs and manual toggles are independent of that setting.
  Assistant prose settles the run, folding every
  activity in it under one summary row. A completed section's toggle summarizes
  only its real, nonzero events
  (commands, unique edited files, tool calls, subagents, and compactions). Each
  section counts only the activities folded into it.
  Empty activity sections are omitted; unclassified activity still has a Work Log
  disclosure rather than disappearing.
- Assistant Markdown follows the prose typography above. Streaming follows the
  latest output only while the reader remains near the bottom.
  File images load from the attached host on every client, resolving relative
  paths against the thread's working directory. File URLs use the same loader;
  HTTP(S) images load through the client's HTTP implementation. This applies to
  standalone images and images mixed with text. Standalone images fit within
  the available width and a 720pt height limit, preserving their aspect ratio
  without cropping. Images mixed with text retain their line-height sizing.
  Clicking a displayed image opens the shared image lightbox, for both standalone
  images and images mixed with text. Images wrapped in a link keep their link action.
  Images are keyboard-focusable controls with the shared focus ring. Enter and
  Space activate them; their accessible name uses the image title or alt text,
  falling back to the link destination or a localized “Open image” label.
  Links to image files render as rounded badges with a leading image icon and
  the link label, the same subtle background as changed-file badges, a border,
  and a hover state. Badges wrap with surrounding prose; long labels truncate
  to the available width. Badges are
  26pt high in 28pt rows, or 38pt high in 44pt rows in compact layouts, leaving
  space between stacked badges. They open the shared image lightbox,
  loading host files through the attached host. Other links retain prose styling.
  The lightbox is up to 1200pt wide, capped to the viewport with at least 16pt side
  margins, and its image is limited to 75% of the window height. Short windows
  shrink the image further to leave room for the dialog header and padding.
- User messages: right-aligned bubble, muted bg, radius 12, max-width 75%.
- A confirmed provider handoff inserts a subtle centered divider chip before
  the next user bubble: “Relayed from X to Y”. The injected handoff transcript
  is provider-only context and never renders as a message or disclosure row.
- **Disclosure rows** fold injected, non-conversational context out of the
  bubbles into a reusable centered control: a collapsed-by-default row of 12px
  muted `label ›` whose chevron rotates and whose background lifts to accent on
  hover. Clicking toggles a per-entry expansion (state lives on the chat view,
  keyed by entry id — not global), revealing the injected text verbatim as 13px
  muted preformatted prompt source inside a bordered muted card. Because that
  text can be long (orchestrate guidance), the card is a resolved-height,
  capped-at-320px scroll viewport of its own rather than growing the turn. Two
  things render as disclosure rows today: an `/orchestrate` turn shows an
  "Orchestrate Skill ›" row above a bubble that now holds only the user's own
  words (the injected guidance + configuration prefix is the disclosure; the
  provider still receives the whole composed text); and a child-thread callback
  renders as a single "`{title, ≤24 chars…} {state} ›`" row **instead of** a
  bubble. A disclosure row sits where the turn's user bubble would start and
  keeps the surrounding turn rhythm. Message actions follow the split: the
  orchestrate bubble's Copy copies only the visible user text; callback rows are
  not bubbles and carry **no** action row. Messages logged before the split
  annotation existed lack it
  and render as an ordinary full bubble, exactly as before.
- **Message actions.** Every message reserves a 24px action row under it (the
  height is always taken, so revealing it never shifts the timeline). It is
  hidden until the message is hovered — except on the newest user and newest
  assistant message, where it stays visible so the actions are reachable without
  hovering. Ghost xsmall buttons, icon + label:
  - user bubble (right-aligned row): **Copy**, plus a provider-native rewind
    menu when that provider supplied a checkpoint for the turn. Claude Code
    offers **Restore code and conversation**, **Restore conversation**, and
    **Restore code**; conversation options are unavailable on the first turn
    because there is no preceding assistant state. Rewind is disabled while a
    turn or another rewind is active. Steered messages carry Copy alone.
  - assistant message (left-aligned row): **Copy**.
  - Copy puts the message's **raw text** (the markdown source, not the rendered
    document) on the clipboard and flips to "Copied!" for 2s.
- **Provider-native rewind.** Tcode owns no checkpoint store and never truncates
  its event log. For supported Claude Code versions, replayed user-message UUIDs
  become opaque turn checkpoints and the menu forwards Claude's native file and
  conversation rewind controls. Only after the provider confirms the operation
  does Tcode append a rewind event; the folded timeline then hides the rewound
  turns. Claude's conversation prefill is placed in the normal composer. File
  coverage follows Claude Code's own checkpoint semantics (direct file-edit
  tools, not arbitrary external filesystem writes). Codex currently exposes
  only a deprecated conversation-only `thread/rollback`, so Tcode intentionally
  offers no Codex rewind action until a stable native capability can express the
  requested semantics.
- **Errors are never truncated or folded away.** A provider/app error renders as
  its own block: a danger-tinted card (10px radius, danger border at 35%, danger
  bg at 6%) with an uppercase 11px ERROR label, a Copy button, and the FULL
  message wrapped at 13px/20px. Errors deliberately do not join the Work Log's
  activity rows, which are ellipsized and collapse when the turn ends.
  A failed provider start additionally leaves the unsent message in the
  queue strip (typed text is never destroyed by a dead process).
  When a Claude usage window is exhausted, the card adds a resume row: either a
  live reset countdown with Cancel, or a button to schedule the resume manually.
- Changed-file evidence sits in the flow as a quiet summary and clickable file
  chips, showing three files initially with a Show more/Show fewer control.
  Codex uses its replacement `turn/diff/updated` net snapshot; providers without
  that capability fold only successfully completed structured file edits and
  label the result **PARTIAL**. Neither path compares ambient workspace state,
  so external edits are never claimed by the turn. The evidence remains visible
  when activity details fold; desktop chips and View diff open the diff panel.
- Finished turn's bottom row keeps the muted local completion clock; when the
  turn has a trustworthy timestamped breakdown, it appends "Total", "AI
  thinking & response", and "Tool calls" durations via the row's existing
  middle-dot grammar, rolling hour-scale spans up to `Hh MMm SSs` so they stay
  readable. Turns with legacy or untrustworthy timestamps show just the bare
  clock.
- Floating "⌄ Scroll to end" pill when not at bottom.

### Composer

The composer holds the draft plus removable attachment, terminal-context and
review-comment chips. Its controls select the provider/model, model parameters,
approval mode and Build/Plan mode, subject to provider capabilities. Context
usage comes from the live session. Compact composers keep the model picker,
the full reasoning-effort value and Send on one non-wrapping row inside the
input card. Other model parameters remain in the effort chip's details sheet.
An always-visible drawer attaches directly below the card, inset 8pt on each
side with a muted fill and rounded bottom corners. It holds the access picker,
Build/Plan toggle and a trailing context ring. These controls keep 44pt touch
targets; access and context open their details sheets. The model name may
truncate when space is tight, while the effort value stays fully visible.
The card and drawer fit at 360pt in English and Simplified Chinese.
The context details distinguish the latest main-conversation request from
processed traffic. Claude occupancy is the latest input plus cache-read and
cache-creation tokens; generated output and repeated requests do not inflate it.
Capacity stays visible independently and respects the selected model limit. Unknown observations
say **Unknown**, with no measured percentage or empty progress bar. During a new
turn the previous observation says **Last known context · updating** until replaced.
Older saved events without provenance stay unverified until a new observation;
their aggregate counts are never relabeled as measured occupancy. **Total processed**
is a separate lifetime main-loop total, reconstructed from completed turn traffic.
Compaction has separate in-progress and completed dividers, with supplied trigger
and pre-compaction count. Labels wrap at narrow widths. Completion invalidates
occupancy until another request observation, even when the harness reports a
post-compaction size. Warning color is not a claim about the harness's trigger.

Settings → Usage and the composer's account limits use the resolved profile's
account-usage capability. Unsupported custom endpoints/API-key configurations
are omitted independently of session context usage. Native account profiles,
including custom-named profiles, retain sign-in/network errors and retry.
Changing profile configuration or secrets invalidates cached limits and rejects
older in-flight results.

Sending during a turn queues the message;
the secondary send action steers when the provider supports it. Stop interrupts
the current turn. Queue/steer guidance belongs in the send tooltip.

The checkout row below the desktop composer shows the working directory and
Git branch. Voice input is available on supported macOS 26 builds: live partial
text replaces its provisional range at the insertion anchor, final text commits
it, and stopping keeps the transcript without sending. Escape, submit and
thread changes also stop dictation. Compact clients hide this entry point.

A finalized, unresolved proposed plan adds a "Plan Ready" header with a dismiss
button and changes the empty primary action to Implement. In Plan mode any
sendable draft (text, images, terminal context, or review comments) uses Refine
and the refine placeholder; in Build mode the composer keeps its ordinary Send
affordance, because a typed message there is an ordinary build turn.
The compact drawer's Build/Plan control toggles in place; its access control
opens the approval-mode picker. Narrow desktop composers retain their overflow
popover, where Build/Plan toggles and closes the popover and access is a summary.

Model picker popover: left rail = favorites star + provider
glyphs; search input; rows = model name (✓ current) + provider subtitle,
⌘1…⌘9 (macOS) / Ctrl+1…Ctrl+9 (Windows/Linux) chips, favorite star; footer note
when a live session will restart (via resume) on model change. Picking a
different provider on a thread with at least one
completed turn defers the switch until send. Send opens a “Conversation relay”
confirmation; confirming starts that provider fresh and sends a canonical
timeline transcript (project, original provider/model, turn messages, compact
work outcomes, and plan/todo state, capped at roughly 60k characters) plus the
new message. Later messages use the new provider's native cursor. Empty or
incomplete threads switch silently without a transcript.

Approval and user-input panels sit above the composer. Preserve the provider
request, available decisions, free-text answers and editor prefill; show the
full actionable detail. Approval actions include deny, allow, allow for the
thread and cancel the turn where supported.

Pi extension select, input, and editor dialogs surface through the native
user-input panel, including editor prefill in its free-text field.

### Diff panel

Right resizable split (default 560px, min 320px). Sidebar · chat · right panel
are **one** resizable group: nesting a second group inside the chat panel does not
shrink the chat — the right panel is painted over it and the timeline and composer
are clipped mid-word. The chat column reflows; it never clips.

The panel has expand/close controls, a diff-scope selector, unified/split
layout, wrap, whitespace-insensitive and invisibles toggles.

The body is a variable-height virtual GPUI list backed by a Zed-inspired
pipeline: full old/new texts use imara-diff histogram hunks, with patch parsing
as fallback. Word-level changed-token highlights layer over syntax runs;
collapsed gaps expand without re-diffing, and split rows pair by content.
Loading, highlighting, and row construction run on background executors, while
the render path constructs only visible file headers and rows.
Unified and split rows share syntax highlights and line-number drag selection.
Unified rows use two 44px gutters and a 2px change-color rail; each split cell
uses a 42px gutter without the rail. Both retain an 18px minimum row height.

The terminal is host state, not a client's own emulator. The host owns the
grid and publishes it — cells, cursor, modes and scrollback — so every attached
client renders the same screen, and a client that attaches mid-session sees
exactly what the host sees. Scrolling and selection are local to each viewer:
two clients read different parts of the same terminal without disturbing each
other, and only the keys and mouse reports a client sends reach the shell.
Keyboard input is encoded from the replicated modes, so bracketed paste,
application cursor keys and mouse reporting behave the same everywhere. In-grid
images are not supported: the terminal is a coding tool's terminal, and it
renders text.

A stored command's output in the chat timeline is the same grid, rendered on
demand. The client measures the width it can show and asks the host for that
item at that many columns; the host replays the captured bytes through its own
emulator and answers with one finished screen. The panel shows the plain text
until the answer arrives, keeps the answer per width, and asks again once a
width change settles.

The Preview tab exists on every client. Its URL field, open-in-system-browser
and copy-URL work everywhere; the embedded browser, history, JS automation and
screenshots need a system webview. macOS, Windows and Android builds have
an embedded browser (screenshots are supported on macOS and Android). Android
uses an activity-attached child window for each WebView above the GPUI surface
(NativeActivity does not paint ordinary Java view children), follows the panel bounds
through rotation and keyboard insets, and hides it when leaving the compact
Preview destination. Page inputs use the WebView’s native keyboard focus. Without one the tab explains that and offers the portable actions rather
than dead back/reload/screenshot controls, agent automation requests are
answered with an explicit "unsupported" instead of timing out, and such a client
does not subscribe as an owner of the session's preview at all. Localhost port
discovery scans the client, so it is offered only for a local desktop workspace; a host
URL typed into the field is relative to the attached machine. Remote Windows and Android embedded previews route all HTTP(S) traffic through the
machine's token-authenticated forward proxy, including localhost; the URL bar
never substitutes the machine's LAN address. Proxy setup completes before page
navigation and follows attachment teardown. Unsupported proxy capabilities fail
closed through the existing unavailable/load-error presentation. macOS attached
previews refuse WebView creation and explain that the machine proxy cannot be
applied safely: WebKit bypasses it for client-local destinations, including
subresources. URL entry, copy, and open externally remain available. Local desktop
attachments use no preview proxy. Hosting enables the proxy automatically on the
hosting port, without another setting. See [remote networking](remote.md#networking)
for platform requirements and the token's network-access implications.

Right-panel state (open/closed, Diff/Plan/Preview tab, expansion and selected
turn), each Preview WebView, and the bottom terminal workspace all belong to the
conversation destination rather than the shared window. Stored threads key by
session id; unsent drafts use their own session ids so two drafts in one
project keep separate state. Switching conversations moves
the live terminal workspace with its PTYs, scrollback, tabs, splits and attached
context. Because WebViews are native child overlays rather than GPUI scene
nodes, their visibility is synchronized directly from app state: closing
Preview, selecting Diff/Plan, switching conversations, opening the command
palette, or leaving Chat hides every WebView that no longer owns the panel.
Compact conversation-exit teardown follows the **Panel** rule above.

### Settings (wide route)

Settings replaces the **whole window**: opening it switches the window to the
settings page, and the left column is the settings rail — not the workspace
sidebar, which is gone while the route is showing. This is the one route that
does so; Machines instead replaces only the content column and keeps the sidebar
beside it. The rail is therefore the window's left column: it carries the
wordmark, clears the platform's window controls, groups its sections under
**This device** and **‹machine› settings** captions, and ends in the row that
leaves Settings.

Settings uses a left navigation column and independently scrolling content.
Groups share the composer's opaque floating-card treatment. Rows pair a title
and description with a control; sparse groups use space, dense lists use inset
hairlines. Restore defaults requires confirmation. Compact clients have no room
for the rail beside the content: the same sections become a full-width list that
pushes to one section at a time, and both pages wear the shell's one nav bar —
Back to whatever Settings was opened from, then Back to the section list. The
compact page draws no header of its own.

**Compact rows stack.** Where a wide row puts its label left and its control
right, a compact row puts the label and description above a full-width control:
no fixed-width label column, prose that wraps rather than overflowing, and no
horizontal clipping. A row whose control is a 44pt switch keeps it beside the
label at both widths, since a switch never squeezes the text.

Both the compact list and wide rail divide Settings into two captioned groups,
in this order: **This device** contains General (appearance, language and device
name) plus Other devices wherever the build can host connections; **‹machine
name› settings** contains Providers, Usage, Orchestrate, Computer Use, Browser
and Archived Threads. The attached host's display name supplies ‹machine name›;
a local attachment uses the machine name shown by the hosting panel, and a
client with neither uses **Machine settings**. The captions use the same compact
11px muted caption style as captions inside Settings pages; this grouping is
ownership guidance, not a platform test.

Computer Use and Browser configure a *screen* — the one the agent drives — so
they sit at the end of the machine group under a collapsible **Advanced**
disclosure. It is expanded by default wherever this client drives a screen of
its own: the local desktop, and a desktop with computer-use capability attached
to another machine. On a client attached elsewhere with no computer use of its
own — a phone, a browser tab — it starts collapsed, so the machine's list leads
with the sections that can do work there. Opening one of those sections from a
deep link or the palette expands the disclosure rather than selecting a section
the rail does not show.

A section is listed only when at least one of its rows applies to the current
device and attachment. Applicability comes from capabilities, never directly
from the operating system: replicated machine settings remain editable over a
remote link, while operations that drive a local native facility require that
facility here. Thus Browser is omitted without an embedded preview backend and
Other devices is omitted without hosting support. A mixed section stays listed
for its applicable rows and withholds only the unavailable rows. Computer Use
configuration is replicated and stays editable; only its **System permissions**
group is local — it shows live status and Grant/Recheck when this build can read
them *and* the workspace is this machine's, and otherwise says to manage system
permissions on the named host. A client never reports the host's permission
state from its own OS. A stale deep link or command targeting a withheld section
lands on the Settings root rather than opening an empty page.

Editable fields are seeded from the host's settings the first time a real
snapshot exists, not from local defaults, and a field the user has since edited
is never rewritten by a later snapshot.

Provider profiles expose only applicable options. Pi defaults to no Tcode
permission extension; its Native approvals toggle enables the gate for
supervised and auto-accept-edits sessions. Without it those stored modes take
effect as Full access, while Read only uses pi's native tool filter. Trust
project extensions adds `--approve` at launch. Pi has no MCP client; explicitly
enabled orchestration or computer-use registrations produce an unavailable-tools
warning. Using Tcode from other devices is documented in
[Use Tcode from other devices](remote.md), and
permissions in [computer use](computer-use.md).

Orchestrate uses one provider-neutral workflow, refreshed on each explicit
`/orchestrate` message. The main thread frames and decides, routes concrete work
to execution models across the enabled provider fleet, and independently accepts
or rejects the actual integrated result. Small tasks reduce coordination overhead,
not execution ownership. Work that can advance concurrently is routed according
to task dependencies; the main thread integrates parallel deliverables, resolves
conflicts, and retains final acceptance of the integrated result. Optional peer
discussion remains separate from execution. A child report informs the main
thread's judgment but is not itself acceptance; the main thread retains discretion
over proportionate verification.

Settings show two model lists: **Collaboration models**, bundled
with GPT-6 Astra and Claude Fable 5.1, and **Execution models**, bundled with
GPT-6 Astra and Claude Opus 5. The two Astra rows are separate role-specific
profiles with different descriptions. Other models may still initiate `/orchestrate`.
`collaborate` opens a read-only peer discussion, continued through `send`;
`dispatch` assigns concrete work to execution models. Model selection considers
the whole cross-provider fleet, preferring Tcode Orchestrate to native subagents.
Each collaboration model can be switched on or off independently. Its switch
controls whether it can be invited through `collaborate`, never whether it may
serve as the main decision model. Turning every peer off still permits the main
thread to use `/orchestrate` and dispatch execution work. Status chips and switch
tooltips explicitly name collaboration to make this distinction visible.

Each provider/model ID occurs once per list, regardless of endpoint. The same ID
may have separate collaboration and execution profiles. Each add picker excludes
models configured in its own list, and settings patches enforce within-list uniqueness.
Each row has an editable description, enable switch, restore/delete actions,
a read-only list of available reasoning efforts, and a Fast switch when supported
(or when a stored value needs to remain visible). Effort is selected per tool call
from the live provider catalog, with bundled startup fallbacks. There is no saved
fixed-effort field. Collaboration is limited to medium/high; omitted effort uses
medium when available. The GPT-6 executor is dispatched at low only; higher efforts
are never used for it. Its description names computer use as a headline strength.
Fast mode remains independent.
Once a provider catalog is loaded, a configured model absent from it is rendered
unavailable with the catalog mismatch and dispatch or collaboration is rejected;
an empty pre-discovery catalog continues to use bundled fallbacks.

The main workflow has no self-concept. Peer descriptions contain their collaboration
self-concepts: the main thread sees only other peers, and a consulted peer receives
its own description with the discussion brief. These texts emphasize complementary
perspectives, useful initiative within scope, and proportionate verification.
Astra may use Computer Use in a collaboration thread to gather focused decision
evidence by observing and reading the app UI. It reports visible state, state ids,
read text, and discrepancies rather than treating observation as implementation.
It operates the UI only when the lead's brief explicitly requests it and the
thread's access mode permits it. Bulk UI sweeps and code changes remain execution
work for `dispatch`. Enabled Computer Use registrations are attached to child
threads, including collaboration children.

Both add-model popovers reuse the provider/model picker with fixed tabs and a
300px scrollable model list.

Theme, language and device name belong to the client. An explicit client choice
overrides the attached host's replicated setting; restoring that row reveals the
host setting again. Changing hosts replaces the workspace store, shell and all
descendant views in the same window. The local kernel and remote hosting controls
remain alive independently, so connecting to a host and returning to **This
machine** never relaunch the process and never interrupt other attached
clients.

**Settings → Other devices** is **Let other devices connect to this machine**
and nothing else: the listener, **Let nearby devices find this machine**,
connection codes and **Connected devices**. It needs a listener and a beacon,
so the section only exists where the client can host — a phone or a browser has
no such setting. Choosing which machine to talk to is a product surface, not a
setting: it lives in **Machines**, reached from the sidebar's feature area at
both widths. Adding a machine follows the same rules everywhere: an answer
from a superseded attempt is discarded; the form accepts one HTTP(S) origin;
and a browser fixes that origin to the page that served it, hides discovery,
and hides camera scanning. Pairing confirmation shows the machine name and
**Connect**. Rejected authentication offers **Pair again**.
Protocol mismatch says **Update the app**. The shell banner and
attached machine row show the connection failure reason. The sidebar machine dot
and Machines page share the same severity colors: syncing and reconnecting
use a warning dot, terminal offline failures use a danger dot, and only a
connection that has received its first host message uses a success dot. Syncing
remains visible between hello acceptance and that first message. Connection loss
updates the banner immediately, before the retry delay.

### Command palette (⌘K on macOS, Ctrl+K on Windows/Linux)

Centered top-anchored modal over a dim backdrop: search input; grouped results
— Actions (new thread per project, open settings, toggle theme, toggle diff
panel), Threads (fuzzy over titles) and Messages; footer key hints (↑↓ Navigate ·
Enter Select · Esc Close). A leading `>` restricts results to Actions.

Messages are full-text hits inside stored conversations, shown as the thread
title over the matching snippet; selecting one opens that thread at the hit's
turn. The search itself belongs to the host: it indexes its own session logs, in
its own index order, and clients send only the query text. Every client gets the
group, including compact ones — there is no local session store to reopen. The
client owns presentation only: a 150ms debounce and discarding an answer that a
newer keystroke has already superseded.

### Exporting a thread

The host renders the artifact — it owns the event log and flushes pending writes
first — and writes nothing. The client owns delivery, because "where does this
file go" is a question about the machine the user is at, which over a remote link
is not the host. The export dialog names the file and its size, and offers only
what this client can actually do: **Save** through the platform save panel,
**Download** where the platform has one (a browser Blob), and **Copy** to the
clipboard everywhere. A dismissed save panel is a decision, not a failure, and
reports nothing. An export too large for one response frame is refused with an
explicit size error rather than truncated.

### Importing external history

The project root in **Add project** belongs to the host: whether a path is
absolute and whether it exists are facts about the host's filesystem, so the host
decides and the dialog shows the host's own reason for refusing one. The native
directory picker browses *this* machine, so it appears only for a local
workspace; a remote one types a host path, with the recents list and the import
run also coming from the host. Failures — a refused path, an unreadable recents
scan, a refused import — are shown, never swallowed.

The **Recently active** rows include T3 Code counts read from the host's database.
T3 appears first; matching native session identities are excluded from the same
row's Codex/Claude counts. The T3 count includes eligible archived and settled
threads and excludes known destination sessions. If T3 cannot be read, the scan
shows a warning and keeps the native histories available.

Selecting a recent directory rechecks its T3 project on the host. If found, a
confirmation offers T3 history
with **Yes / 是**, **No / 否**, and **Cancel / 取消**. Custom T3 provider instances
require an explicit choice of a compatible tcode profile before Yes is enabled.
No offers the directory's full Codex/Claude history in a second confirmation,
including native histories represented by T3 in the row counts. Without
T3, that second confirmation appears directly. It lists every detected source:
Yes imports those threads; No adds the project without history. Cancel returns
to the recents list without creating a project or importing anything. A failed
T3 check is shown and lets the user review the other sources or cancel.

Browsing or typing a directory continues to add a project without importing.
These rules apply in the shared dialog at both widths and over remote links.

After confirmation, an import opens a modal, non-dismissible progress dialog
with a bar, the "n of N" line naming the tool being read, and an imported/skipped
summary or failure message and an OK button when finished.

Import progress is host state, not a client-side job. The host keeps the latest
run per project and publishes it, so closing the window, disconnecting, or
attaching a second client never abandons the run or loses its outcome: a client
that attaches after a fast completion still sees the summary. The imported
threads appear in the sidebar before the dialog reports the run finished. A
second import of the same project while one is running is refused rather than
queued.

### Settled threads

The thread context menu offers **Settle / 标记为已处理** and, for settled threads,
**Make active / 恢复为活跃**. Settling applies to a thread and its descendants and
is refused while any affected thread has running work, pending input or approval,
or queued messages. It preserves the selected conversation, provider session,
terminals and worktree. Archive remains a separate, reversible action; automatic
archiving exempts settled threads.

At both widths, active threads precede a collapsible **Settled / 已处理** group.
By project has one group inside each project; Recent has one group after active
threads. Existing ordering and parent/child folds apply within each group. A
settled parent cannot hide active descendants. Settled groups start collapsed,
retain expansion while the UI is open, and expand when navigation selects a
settled thread. Opening or searching does not reactivate it. Accepted messages,
scheduled messages and orchestration input reactivate the recipient and settled
ancestors. Make active restores the matching settle cascade and its ancestors.

The [T3 importer](import-t3.md) preserves explicit settled and archive state.
The offline CLI imports all eligible projects and can refresh previous imports.
Add project's T3 option imports only the selected directory's project and skips
known sessions; it never replaces a conversation owned by the running host.

### Session lifetime

Navigating away from a thread must not cancel its running turn, queued messages
or provider background tasks. Events continue to reach its stored timeline and
sidebar status; returning adopts the resident session. Idle providers may be
retained briefly and reclaimed by the runtime's idle grace period and LRU bound.
That resource policy must not reap sessions with work still in flight.

Dedicated worktree sessions normally live under `~/.tcode/worktrees/<session-id>`;
`TCODE_WORKTREES_DIR` overrides that root for isolated runs. Startup cleanup
removes registered orphan worktrees only after their minimum age, preserving
fresh entries, unknown directories and paths it cannot safely inspect. Projects
may place a `.worktreeinclude` at their repository root to copy required ignored files or directories into each
new worktree. Entries are relative paths, one per line; blank lines and `#`
comments are ignored. Copies never overwrite files Git materialized and stop at
an aggregate 512 MiB limit. The list is entirely user-controlled: including
`.env` files or other credentials copies those secrets into
the worktree directory, where they remain until the worktree is removed.

A clean worktree session can merge its committed branch back into the clean,
branch-attached original checkout. Descendants fast-forward; divergent history
uses a merge commit, with conflicts aborted for manual resolution. Worktrees are
never auto-committed or removed by merge-back. Orchestration can opt children
into the same worktree/session-metadata path globally or per dispatch; non-Git
cwd and creation failures fall back to the resolved cwd and are reported in the
dispatch response.

### Empty state

New-thread drafts center the composer and a 24px semibold heading, "What should
we build in ‹project name›?", together in the available chat area at both widths.
The heading wraps on narrow screens. After the first message, the heading goes
away and the composer returns below the timeline. The same composer entity is
kept throughout, preserving draft text, attachments and focus.

The workspace does not sit on a blank page. When no conversation is open — at
launch, or because the thread on screen was archived or deleted — it opens the
new-thread draft of the project the user last interacted with. In wide layout
the composer is focused and ready. Compact conversations start unfocused,
including restored conversations and drafts; only tapping the composer focuses
it. Compact navigation away from or between conversations blurs the focused
element and dismisses the software keyboard. "Last interacted" is set by user navigation only (opening a thread,
starting a draft); background model activity and archive timestamps never move
it, and it is persisted, so a launch lands where the user left off. A remembered
project that no longer exists falls back to the first project in the sidebar.
That project keeps a single standing draft, so returning to it preserves its
composer attachments.

A thread that is archived while on screen — an Orchestrate child auto-archived
on completion is the common case — hands the workspace to its parent when the
parent is still visible, with the parent's scroll position and panels intact.
Archiving a thread the user is not viewing changes nothing.

Only a workspace with no projects at all reaches the empty page: centered
"Add a project to get started" (15px semibold) over "Tcode works inside a
project folder. Add one to open its first thread." (13px muted) and an
**Add project** button. No composer is rendered. The same page, titled "Pick a
thread to continue" over a list of recent projects, covers the moment before a
draft opens.

## Accessibility

Keyboard focus uses one quiet, keyboard-only outline across raw controls: a
2px outer ring derived from the theme ring token, with theme-specific opacity
so it remains legible over both paper and carbon surfaces without shifting
layout. Component-library controls retain their native focus treatment. Hidden
row actions must enter the normal tab order and reveal themselves when focused,
not depend on pointer hover.

Tab and Shift+Tab move through focusable controls when the focused surface does
not handle the key itself. Navigation stays within the active popup's focus trap.

Interactive surfaces expose the semantic role that matches their behavior
(button, tab, switch, menu item, option, or terminal) and a localized accessible
name. Selection, expansion, and toggle state are reported on the owning control.
Composite menus and listboxes keep keyboard focus in their input or container,
use menu-item/option descendants, and report the highlighted descendant rather
than adding every result to the global tab sequence.

## Verification protocol

Use the validation commands in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and its
linked CI workflow. For visual changes, also launch the affected surface and
review both themes at its normal and narrow widths. Exercise keyboard focus,
scrolling and the changed interaction. Capture the relevant states for the PR;
unit or compile checks alone do not establish visual correctness.

## Headless browser authentication and hosting

The headless web page opens with a centered password form before the shared
canvas starts. First open shows password and confirmation, with a minimum of
eight characters; configured hosts show one password field. Inputs are masked,
labels sit above full-width controls, and the primary action has a 44px minimum
height. Errors stay in the form with an alert role; keyboard focus is visible.
The page follows the browser light/dark preference and fits narrow viewports.
A saved valid token skips login; rejected tokens return to the login form.

In the browser, Settings → Other devices belongs to the attached machine. Its
Allow other devices switch controls new native pairings, not web login. The
current code, expiry and QR use the desktop hosting presentation, stacking on
narrow screens. Paired devices and Remove remain visible when pairing is off.
The listener owns this state and returns it over the authenticated pipe. Native
Add a machine continues to show an address and six-digit connection code.
## Pending writes on weak networks

User-authored sends remain muted with **Sending…** until the host acknowledges
them. During Syncing or Reconnecting the caption is **Waiting for connection…**;
reconnection does not turn a pending send into a delivered bubble. Terminal
failure shows an inline error with **Retry** and **Discard**. Queued approval
decisions keep their controls disabled with a pending caption. The connection
banner owns transient transport failures. See [Weak networks](remote.md#weak-networks)
for persistence, ordering, limits and protocol compatibility.

Pending writes also own launch recovery: a saved machine with a non-empty outbox
wins over normal launch navigation (saved-machine order breaks ties). With no
pending writes desktop still starts locally and mobile restores its last machine.
Attachment opens the first pending thread. This derives only IDs and message
previews from the existing outbox; it adds no offline cache or synthetic host
metadata. Before a snapshot exists, the existing pending-message timeline remains
visible. The snapshot adopts those messages through the normal Ack/replica merge.
The disconnected banner appends the pending write count after its failure reason.
Threads marks cached rows **Pending** and provides one **Waiting for connection…**
row per uncached pending session, with its first message preview, at both widths.
A host deletion arriving before the rejected Ack does not navigate away from an
unresolved send: its inline error and Retry/Discard controls remain on screen.

## macOS Computer Use feedback

The agent cursor is a nonactivating, pointer-passthrough panel, visible only
while its target application is frontmost. Consecutive actions animate to the
latest point; a drag ends at its final point. Untargeted typing and key chords
show keyboard feedback at the current target window's center.

A successful action's marker lasts one second from submission, including queue
delay, and is removed on the next 200ms visibility tick. Switching applications
does not restart this lifetime. Stop, turn completion, a cancelled/failed MCP
request, disabling the cursor or Computer Use, and session/backend teardown
invalidate pending feedback and clear the current marker on the main queue.
Cancellation is session-scoped: it cannot clear another session's newer marker.
Closing or hiding the target window retires its marker even when its process
stays open. See [Computer use](computer-use.md) for the native verification path.
