# Tcode

**A native GUI for the terminal coding agents you already use.**

Claude Code, Codex, pi, OpenCode, and any agent that speaks ACP — one window,
on your desktop, your phone, or in a browser.

## What it is

Tcode is a native GUI proxy for the agent CLIs already installed on your
machine. One Tcode is the *host*: it spawns the agents, speaks their native
protocols, and keeps your threads, terminals and projects. Every other device —
another desktop, a phone, a tablet, a browser tab — is a screen for that host.

Tcode surfaces what each agent's own CLI can do: persistent threads, rendered
diffs, a readable approval panel, and native provider actions when the
underlying CLI exposes them. It does **not** replace your agent, proxy your API
keys, or invent capabilities the agent lacks. Your accounts, subscriptions,
models and tooling keep working exactly as they do today — Tcode just drives
them, and anything it adds to what the model sees is shown to you.

## What you get

**Threads that persist.** Every conversation is an event log on disk, grouped by
project. Close the app, reopen it, keep talking — the agent resumes where it left
off.

**Provider-native rewind.** Claude Code sessions expose Claude's own checkpoint
options for restoring code, conversation, or both. Tcode forwards those native
operations and records the confirmed result; it does not snapshot your Git
working tree or synthesize rollback for providers that lack the capability.

**Diffs, not scrollback.** Syntax-highlighted per-turn diffs in a resizable
split, with a changed-files card on each turn.

**Approvals you can read.** Command execution and file edits surface as a panel
showing the actual command and the actual diff — approve, allow for the session,
or deny. Permission modes run from "ask about everything" to "don't ask".

**Queue and steer.** The composer stays live while a turn runs.
<kbd>Enter</kbd> queues your message and sends it when the turn finishes;
<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> on
Windows/Linux steers when the provider supports it, injecting the message into
the turn in flight. Providers without steering support queue it instead.
Queued messages show above the composer and offer a steer action where supported.

**A terminal, a browser, and a plan.** Per-thread terminal drawer (select output,
send it as context), an embedded preview browser the agent can drive over MCP,
and a live plan/task panel.

## Supported agents

**Native integrations** — the deepest support, over each CLI's own protocol:

| Agent | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) | `claude` on your `PATH` |
| [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) | `codex` on your `PATH` |
| [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) | `pi` on your `PATH` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | `opencode` on your `PATH` |

**Everything else, over [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com).** Tcode ships a
marketplace backed by the official ACP registry.
Install one from **Settings → Providers**, or point Tcode at any command that
speaks ACP.

> ACP entries that duplicate a native integration are deliberately hidden from
> the marketplace so each CLI has one clear, highest-fidelity path.

## Use Tcode from other devices

Tcode runs on the machine that holds your projects, starts your agents, and
keeps your threads. You can open that machine from another desktop, a phone or
tablet, or a browser tab. Native apps connect over **Traverse**: one
end-to-end encrypted connection per device, direct when the network allows it
and through a relay when it does not. Traverse is the relay and lookup service
a machine publishes to; it has no accounts, sees only encrypted traffic and
machine and device ids, and is never part of authentication — the machine
itself decides which devices may connect. It is on by default, can point at a
self-hosted `tcode-traverse` instance, or can be turned off, in which case
devices reach the machine only on its own network: at the addresses its
invitation carries, and, once paired, at the addresses that worked before or
through its DNS-SD advertisement on the LAN. The default instance
uses n0's public iroh relays and lookup service, which n0 describes as
rate-limited with no uptime guarantee.

Every device shows the *same* app. There is no reduced phone build: a phone, or
a tablet narrower than 900px, shows a machines → threads → thread stack; a
wider tablet and every desktop window use the split layout. Some actions depend
on the device in your hands, such as opening a native file dialog or driving the
embedded preview browser.

**Use your desktop as the machine.** In **Settings → Remote**, turn on
**Let other devices connect to this machine**. The sidebar's **Machines** page
then shows the invitation: scan its QR code with the device you want to
connect, or send it the invitation link. An invitation admits one device and
expires after five minutes; the link is the secret, so share it only with that
device.

**Use a server as the machine.** Download `tcode-headless` from
[Releases](https://github.com/Tryanks/tcode/releases), install your agent CLIs
on the server, then:

```sh
tcode-headless serve --name build-server   # prints the machine id, invitation link and QR
tcode-headless pair      # reprints the current invitation while it is valid
```

`serve --traverse off` or `--traverse https://your.instance` changes the
Traverse mode. Headless release builds also serve the browser app, on
`http://127.0.0.1:47420/` by default; `--browser-listen` binds it to a LAN
address. Set a password on first open, or preset it with `TCODE_PASSWORD`.

**Connect another device.** Open the sidebar's **Machines** row on a desktop,
or the opening screen on a phone. Scan the machine's QR code or paste its
invitation link; pairing connects at once. In a browser, open the printed HTTP
link and log in with the password; the browser is for direct access on the
machine or its LAN and does not use Traverse. Its **Settings → Remote** shows
the machine's invitation for native clients and controls pairing and
revocation.
See [Use Tcode from other devices](docs/remote.md) for the full guide.

**Security.** Native connections are authenticated by device and machine keys
and encrypted end to end; a relay carries ciphertext. Removing a device on the
machine closes its connection at once. The browser page is plain HTTP,
protected by the password; keep it on loopback or a trusted LAN. See
[Security](docs/remote.md#security) and
[Self-hosting Traverse](docs/remote.md#self-hosting-traverse) in the remote
guide.

## Getting started

**1. Install Tcode.** Download a build for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/Tryanks/tcode/releases) — macOS (Apple Silicon /
Intel), Windows (x64 / ARM64), Linux (x64 / ARM64) — and run it. Check the release
notes for runtime requirements and signing status. Windows preview uses
WebView2; Linux needs the listed system libraries and a Vulkan driver.

For an unsigned macOS build, remove quarantine after installing the app with
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tcode.app`. The embedded preview
browser is available on macOS, Windows and Android; voice input requires macOS 26 or later.

In-app desktop audio and video playback uses the **libmpv** runtime. Install your Linux
distribution’s libmpv package (for example, `libmpv2` on Debian/Ubuntu), or `mpv`
with Homebrew on macOS. On Windows, place a matching `libmpv-2.dll` or `mpv-2.dll`
beside `tcode.exe`. Android uses its built-in media player. Both show persistent
play/pause, restart, mute, time, and seek controls.

Each release uses the native application icon format for its platform: `.icns`
inside the macOS app bundle, an `.ico` resource embedded directly in the Windows
executable, and an XDG desktop entry plus themed PNG on Linux. Release downloads
also include a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file.

| Platform / device | Release download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS, arm64 / x64 | Desktop `.zip` / `.dmg`; headless `.zip` |
| Windows, x64 / arm64 | Desktop or headless `.zip` |
| Linux, x64 / arm64 | Desktop or headless `.tar.gz` |
| Android, arm64 | `tcode-<version>-android-arm64.apk` — signed with the project's release key; install with adb |
| iOS / iPadOS, arm64 | Not published yet; build from source with `crates/ios/host/build.sh` |
| Browser | Embedded in the headless release; open the HTTP link it prints (HTTPS only through your own tunnel). No separate signed app package |

**2. Have an agent installed.** Tcode drives the CLIs, it doesn't bundle them.
Make sure `claude`, `codex`, `pi` or `opencode` is on your `PATH` — or install an ACP agent from
the marketplace once Tcode is running.

**3. Add a project and start a thread.** Point Tcode at a directory, type, send.
No API keys, no config file required. Optional [project configuration](docs/project-config.md)
can provide a shared project icon.

The interface is localized and follows your system language; you can override it
in Settings. Everything Tcode stores — sessions, settings, installed ACP agents —
lives under your platform's app-data directory.

## Building from source

Build instructions, platform prerequisites, workspace layout, tests and provider
probes are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). To review the compact layout
without a device, open the shared shell at phone geometry:

```sh
cargo run -p tcode-ui --example phone              # 393×852
cargo run -p tcode-ui --example phone -- --android # 412×915
```

The editable macOS 26 source is
[`assets/icons/app/tcode.icon`](assets/icons/app/tcode.icon). Icon Composer's
official 16-bit Display P3 render is committed as
[`assets/icons/app/tcode.png`](assets/icons/app/tcode.png), then converted into
the native macOS and Windows icon formats used by releases.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers
how to build, test, and what to expect from review; participation is governed by
the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Good places to start: a bug you hit, a rough edge in the UI, or a new ACP agent
that doesn't render well.

## Acknowledgements

Tcode's interaction model was inspired by **[T3 Code](https://t3.gg)** by
T3 Tools, and Tcode keeps borrowing good ideas from it: it reads T3 Code's
`t3.json` project configuration and its Claude model manifest.
