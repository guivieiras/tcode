//! The window's attachment to a host: one transport, its pump, and the
//! workspace store built on top of them.
//!
//! The window outlives any single attachment. Switching hosts replaces
//! everything in here and nothing above it, so the guarantees are narrow and
//! worth stating:
//!
//! - **Nothing blocks the window.** Teardown hands back the retiring pump's
//!   completion as a value to await, rather than joining it on the UI thread —
//!   which a browser, running the whole client on one executor, cannot do at
//!   all.
//! - **A retiring task cannot reach the next attachment.** Closing the link
//!   closes its channels first, so anything still in flight is dropped rather
//!   than delivered into the store that replaced it.
//! - **Detaching is not shutting down.** The client's link closes; the host
//!   keeps running, and every other client attached to it keeps working.
