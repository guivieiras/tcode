//! Traverse: the iroh transport for native Tcode clients.
//!
//! One machine runs a [`TraverseHost`]; devices pair with it once and then
//! open a reconnecting [`Transport`](tcode_client::host::Transport) to it.
//! Everything runs on one process-wide tokio runtime; the public API is
//! synchronous and hands out channels, so the GPUI side never sees tokio.
//!
//! On a LAN a paired machine is found again without any service: it
//! advertises DNS-SD and devices resolve it through [`lan`].
//!
//! Two optional layers share the runtime: `native` is the client host and
//! the Preview adapters a native client shows a machine's pages through, and
//! `browser` is the plain HTTP listener a headless machine serves the browser
//! client from.
